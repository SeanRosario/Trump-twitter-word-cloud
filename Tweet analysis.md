## About this analysis:

The world is taking to twitter to express their feelings about businessman, presidential candidate and entertainer, Donald J. Trump

So I decided to analyze what people are saying by making a word cloud of popular words.

Just for fun, they're shaped and colored to match a very angry Donald Trump (see result towards the end)

The data I used is available at: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bigdataclassecc/twitterdata.txt, from NYU graduate course DS-GA 1004- Big Data

Note: To run this on your local machine, follow the setup instructions at https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud/


## Loading the packages


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import re
from os import path
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS, ImageColorGenerator
%matplotlib inline
import pylab
from pylab import rcParams
```

## Reading the data


```python
text = ""
with open("twitterdata.txt", "r") as all_tweets:
    count =0
    for tweet in all_tweets:
        tweet_contains_Donald = re.search('Donald', str(tweet), re.IGNORECASE) != None
        tweet_contains_Trump =  re.search('Trump', str(tweet), re.IGNORECASE) != None
        # bing bing bong bong bing bing bing
        if tweet_contains_Donald or tweet_contains_Trump:
            text = text + tweet #[:-1] + " " #Each line ends with a \n so I replace that with a space.
            count+=1
```


```python
print "We are taking "+str(count)+" Trump-related tweets"
```

    We are taking 60471 Trump-related tweets



```python
#Previewing the first 100 characters
print text[0:100]
```

    more I read about the scandals in the Clinton Global Initiative the more concerned I am that Trump w

Note: To make the tiny words are readable, I made the pictures huuuuuuge.


### Understanding the word cloud
The size of the words correspond to their frequency of occurence among tweets

### Let's look at some of the most popular words:

* MakeDonaldDrumfAgain  - John Oliver did a segment where he asked people to tweet with this hashtag
* realDonalTrump - This is his twitter handle
* https - most links starts with this sequence of characters. People were tweeting links (most likely Trump-related articles)

Fun Trump quote: "I know words, I have the best words'
